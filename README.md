## Simeple Overview
This JavaScript code provides a simple way to add a text blink effect to an HTML element and redirect the user to a specific URL when a key is pressed.
The code uses document.querySelector() to find the first HTML element with the class "blink" and sets an interval to toggle the "hide" class on the element every 600 milliseconds, creating the text blink effect.
Additionally, it defines a redirectToHomepage() function that redirects the user to the URL "https://netcore.digital/" using window.location.replace() if the function is available. Finally, it sets the window.onkeypress event handler to the redirectToHomepage() function, so that when a key is pressed, the function is called and the user is redirected to the specified URL.
